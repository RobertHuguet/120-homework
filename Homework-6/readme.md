# Empty p5 sketch.

I used random numbers assigned to variables and stored in objects. The objects were used to place ellipse on the canvas and assign them different colors and transparency. I also used the mouse click button to reset the canvas and set the background and set the red and green values to something that would match the background.
When the size of the window is changed, the only part of the screen that is active is what it was changed to. This is because of the use of windowWidth and windowHeight. I decided to keep it this way for the other functionality.

I learned how to make cool random art.
