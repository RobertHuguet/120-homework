# Empty p5 sketch.

Robert Huguet

T  This week I learned about GitHub, SourceTree, and
Atom. I made txt files through Unbutu a Command Prompt program. I did this by following instructions provided by the professor. There were several issues I had, but mostly with trying to make sure everything was done properly. To solve this I double checked stuff and when things became clear or when I realized that I had done something wrong, I started back at where I went wrong until everything was right.

Current p5 version -> 0.7.1
