I learned about GitHub, SourceTree, and Atom. I made txt files through Unbutu a Command Prompt program.

2.What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
Did you have any problems or issues?

I followed the instructions provided by the professor. There were several issues, but mostly with trying to make sure everything was done properly.


3.How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

I double checked stuff and when things became clear or when I realized that I had done something wrong, I started back at where I went wrong until everything was right.

4.Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

Not particularly, but I would like to know why there was several repeat material pages and the new-item command didn't work for my windows computer and touch did.

5.What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

I didn't have anything to contribute during this homework cycle.
