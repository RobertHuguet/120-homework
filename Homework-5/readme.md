# HW-5
I created an evolving sketch with several ellipse that move across the screen in different colors. The ellipse change size based on where the mouse is on the screen. where the mouse is there is also a box that grows based on where the mouse is on the y axis. In the center there are several lines that grow in a star pattern.

I learned about making things evolve over time and how to use the mouse to change things on the canvas.
