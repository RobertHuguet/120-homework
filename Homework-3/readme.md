["Hello World!" Sketch](https://roberthuguet.github.io/120-homework/Homework-3/)

I created my first Hello World! page in java. I also made some other sketches in my Homework-3 file looking at the functions we learned like the ellipse function and different backgrounds.

All of this was done while I was following along with the instructional videos and the examples on the course page. I didn't have any problems while following along this week! I have learned visual basic and python in the past, so all of this comes naturally for me. I am excited to learn more of the java language to add it to my skill set.  

During this homework cycle I did not get the opportunity to help other classmates as I have just gotten the approval to stay in my classes this semester and am behind.
